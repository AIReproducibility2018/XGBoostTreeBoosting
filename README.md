# XGBoostTreeBoosting

This repo contains code to reproduce parts of the results from the paper "XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system" [1].


The version of xgboost used for reproducing the article was from the [xgboost repo at commit `c09ad421a8a5d63ac1ee825a7b8195f7cb7f7740`](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/commit/c09ad421a8a5d63ac1ee825a7b8195f7cb7f7740).

The datasets in the article that were attempted reproduces were "Higgs Boson" [2] and "Yahoo! learning to rank challenge
dataset" [3].
